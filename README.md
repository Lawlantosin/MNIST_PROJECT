# MNIST_PROJECT
The MNIST database has become a cornerstone in the field of image processing and machine 
learning. This database consists of handwritten digits that have been extensively used for training 
and testing different kind of image processing systems. The database was developed by combining 
data samples from NIST's original datasets, as the creators believed that the original dataset was 
not suitable for machine learning experiments due to its source and image normalization. The 
MNIST database includes sixty thousand (60,000) training images and ten thousand (10,000)
testing images. (MNIST handwritten digit database, Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Chris 
Burges, no date). The main objective is to perform some hyper-parameter tuning by using different 
regularization, changing number of convolution blocks and varying learning rates on the dataset.
